This is a very basic client-server setup that enables groups of friend to do a Secret Santa assignment over the internet.


## How to run

On the host machine, configure the port and participant number in the config.py file and run the `server.py` file which will initalize the server as such:

```
python server.py
```

On the client machine also configure the proper ip and port and run the `client.py` file as such:

```

There are no requirements further than a basic python3.x installation
